# Create a database in postgressql with db name "myschool"

# Configure the postgres credentials and port in DATABASE_URL of .env file

# Logger is implemented to log any errors in the console. So when an error occurs please check in the console as well

# Install the node modules with command "npm install" and run "npm run dev" to run the project

# Tests can be run using command "npm test". As a precautionary measure create an empty test db and configure it in .env file rather using original db. More than 90% test coverage is added which is displayed in the coverage report.

# Postman collection is attached in root folder which can be imported in postman to ease testing
